# go-package-template

## Basics

- Go templates are a powerful method to customize output however you want, whether you’re creating a web page, sending an e-mail, working with Buffalo, Go-Hugo, or just using some CLI such as kubectl.
- There’re two packages operating with templates — text/template and html/template.
- Both provide the same interface.
- However, the html/template package is used to generate HTML output safe against code injection.
